Rule: AMR Analytics Workflow
Goal

To build AMR analytics based on the user's instructions.

Implementation Guidelines
Core Development Rules

Do NOT generate code unless the user explicitly requests it.

All implementation must be structured clearly and modularly.

Confirm requirements with the user before starting any implementation.

For large features, break them into clear steps and tackle one at a time.

For every feature/component completed, provide a 3–4 line summary describing:

What was done

What the logic/component does

Why it is important for the system

Follow world-class coding practices: clean, modular, and maintainable.

Never execute commands directly. Always provide CLI commands as markdown code blocks formatted for Windows command prompt.

All logic must be traceable and verifiable with logs, checkpoints, or progress indicators.


Each implementation should be testable if the user asks

When debugging or fixing errors, ensure existing working logic is not broken. Every fix should be isolated, traceable, and tested.

Only build what’s necessary for the current scope.

Keep visual feedback and implementation tracking tightly integrated.

Avoid unnecessary performance bottlenecks or redraws.
